<h2>THE HAMLIN NURSERY.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THE little Hamlins were all down with
the scarlet fever; and when we say the
Little Hamlins, we mean Lucy, Cathie,
Harry, Bertie, and the baby; five of
them! It was a hard time in the Hamlin
nursery, both for the children and the older
people. Though Mrs. Hamlin had a nurse from
the training school, besides the children's regular
attendant, she was quite worn out with the care
and anxiety.</div>

<p>"The very last Sabbath I was in church," said
she to Doctor Wheeler, "Mr. Lewis said in his
sermon, that even our afflictions had a blessing
wrapped up in them. But I do not believe there
is one inside this trouble. I can't conceive of
any good that can possibly come out of it all!"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," replied Doctor
Wheeler, "I should never have conceived of
anything like that statue, yet it was inside the
marble all the time, and plainly discerned by the
eye of the sculptor. There are things in the
spiritual world which we cannot conceive until
they are revealed to us."</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Hamlin shook her head doubtfully.
She was very sure no good could grow out of
this trial. Doctor Wheeler was a sweet-voiced
little woman who looked upon the bright side
of things and whom the children loved; they
were very sorry for their little friend across the
street who had the fever and whose father insisted
upon sending for that gruff old Doctor
Smith, who never had a smile for children.</p>

<p>"Your children have good constitutions and
you have good nurses, I see no reason why they
should not pull through easily," said Doctor
Wheeler when Mr. Hamlin asked her opinion as
to the prospects of the recovery of his little
folks. "But what about that oldest boy of yours?
Does he not have an Easter vacation?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I suppose he ought not to come
home?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly not! It will not be safe for
several weeks; he must be kept away from this
vicinity, though I hope the disease will not
spread. You should send word for him to remain
at the school through the vacation."</p>

<p>It was a very sober face indeed that presented
itself at Doctor Brown's study door, a day
or two after this conversation took place.</p>

<p>Doctor Brown was the principal of Howland
Hall School for boys, and was the right man in
the right place.</p>

<p>"What is it, Fred?" he asked kindly. "Come
in and let me hear about it."</p>

<p>"It is this," replied Fred Hamlin, handing the
Doctor his father's letter.</p>

<p>"Ah! Well, my boy, it might be worse
news. You understand, the little folks at home
are all on the high road to recovery, and it is on
your account that you are not to go home."</p>

<p>"I know; but it will be dreadful lonesome
here with the boys all away."</p>

<p>"That is so; and what will make it worse is,
that we have planned a little trip which will
take us all away excepting Mr. and Mrs. Jennings.
I am afraid it will be rather doleful for
you alone in this great house; but that will be
better than the scarlet fever. Eh?"</p>

<p>Fred turned away in a very disconsolate frame
of mind. The Easter vacation to which he had
been looking forward was likely to be anything
but pleasant. Now Fred Hamlin was by no
means a model boy, and matters did not always
go smoothly with him at home. His own mother
died when he was a baby, and his grandmother
had taken charge of him until Fred was ten
years old. Then she too died, and the boy was
taken home by his father. The second mother
tried earnestly to win the boy's heart, but seeds
of suspicion and jealousy had been dropped into
the young mind, and he refused to be won.
After three years of trial Mr. Hamlin concluded
to send Fred to school. Doctor Brown had the
reputation of being a strict disciplinarian, and
Mr. Hamlin hoped much as a result of school
discipline. But Watt Vinton, Fred's room-mate,
knew very well that any such expectations were
not likely to be realized. I cannot tell you of
all the ways in which Fred contrived to make
himself disagreeable to his quiet and gentlemanly
companion. But so well did he succeed,
that Watt, sometimes, with his face buried in the
pillow, would whisper just to himself, "He is
the hatefulest, meanest, crossest fellow I ever
saw! I don't believe he has a particle of respect
or love for anybody on earth!" Now perhaps
you will almost doubt me when I tell you that
the pillow was Watt's only confident. He never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
breathed a word of his troubles to a single person.
There were several reasons for this reticence.
Watt was an orphan, and had learned to
keep his troubles to himself. He was too proud
to complain; he had a notion that it would be
more manly to endure annoyances than to make
a fuss over them. It was only when he got out
of patience that he took his troubles to his friend
the pillow. This will explain why Watt Vinton
frowned a little over a letter which he received
a few days before the Easter vacation, and why
he carried it in his pocket a whole day before
coming to a decision in regard to one of its
propositions. The letter was from his cousin,
May Vinton, and here is one sentence from it:
"Now that it is settled that you are to spend
your vacation here, would you like to bring a
boy with you? If there is somebody who cannot
go home, or who needs a chance, whom you
would like to bring, you may invite him to be
your guest for the week."</p>

<p>It took Watt a whole day to make up his mind
that he could do it. But at the end of the
twenty-four hours he wrote to his cousin, "I am
going to bring my chum."</p>

<p>Well, what came of it all&mdash;the scarlet fever,
Mrs. Hamlin's trouble, Fred's disappointment,
and Watt's sacrifice?</p>

<p>Do you suppose God knew that May Vinton
could reach that wayward boy's heart, and help
him to a better life, and so planned all this to
bring about the meeting? Do you not suppose
that he knew that Watt's sacrifice would make
him stronger and better? It was a day or two
after the boys reached the beautiful home of the
Vintons that Fred sat in May's lovely room,
chatting confidentially with her. Watt had
been called to the library by his guardian, and
the boy was left alone with the loveliest young
lady he had ever met. Just how it was I do not
know; Fred himself does not know, but it was
not long before he was telling this new and it
seemed to him first friend he had ever known,
all his story; how nobody loved him, and how
he hated everybody; how dreadful it was to
have a stepmother, and a great deal of nonsense
which to the mistaken and misunderstood boy
seemed very solemn truth.</p>

<p>I have not space in which to tell you how May
Vinton helped him to a better understanding of
himself, and of his position. But at the close of
one of the many conversations which they had
during Fred's visit, he said:</p>

<p>"I see how it is! I have been more to blame
than anybody else. But the boys have got so
used to expecting hatefulness from me, they
would never understand if I tried to do differently."</p>

<p>"Never is a long time," said Miss Vinton.</p>

<p>One day Watt said to his cousin, "What have
you done to Fred? He is so different here!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps more will come of your sacrifice
than you expected," replied May quietly.</p>

<p>"What do you know about a sacrifice?" asked
Watt quickly.</p>

<p>A smile was her only reply.</p>

<p>More did grow out of it all than anyone would
have suspected. May Vinton's seed-sowing was
on good ground. By her love and sympathy
she had softened the soil, and the heart of the
friendless boy opened to the refining and elevating
influences she threw around him, and a month
later Watt wrote, "Fred is just as different as
you can think. The boys all like him now."</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>GRANDMA BURTON looked steadily at
the first verse, and laughed. "I wish I
could show you children the picture I see whenever
I read this verse," she said. "Though I
don't know as you would think I ought to feel
much like laughing."</div>

<p>"Why, Grandma?" and, "O Grandma, tell
us what you see!" and, "Grandma, show us the
picture, won't you?" this was the chorus which
greeted her laugh.</p>

<p>"Dear me! It isn't much of a story, but I remember
it as well as though it happened yesterday.
I was a little thing, not much over four, I
should think. It was a warm Sunday, and first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
I see myself in church. I was in my best dress,
a lovely white slip with blue stars all over it."</p>

<p>"Grandma, who ever heard of blue stars?"
This from Marion.</p>

<p>"I did, child, many a time when I was of
your age, and younger; it used to be the favorite
print. Mine was very pretty and was made
in the latest fashion&mdash;a yoke in the neck, and a
long full skirt. I had slippers, too, with straps
which went around my ankle and buttoned at
the side; those slippers had just come in, and I
felt very fine in them. I had a shirred hat of
white mull, with a puffing of pink ribbon around
the edge, and a pink bow exactly on the top. I
went to church with father and mother; the
high, old-fashioned pew was rather an uncomfortable
seat; the only relief I had was to kick
my heels softly against the back. I remember
it seemed to take the ache out of them wonderfully.
Generally I was a pretty good girl in
church, but on this day I don't know what was
the matter with me&mdash;I had the fidgets. Mother
shook her head, and grandma gave me a caraway
seed to suck, and father looked at me over his
spectacles, but it all did no good, I could not seem
to sit still. I plaited folds in my nicely-starched
calico until mother took my hand and held it for
awhile; then I took off my hat and tried to
hang it on the button which fastened the door,
until father took it away; then I turned the
leaves of the psalm book until it scared me by
dropping on the floor with a thud. Oh! I
couldn't begin to tell you all the naughty things
I did; but the last and most dreadful was to
fumble in my brother Ralph's pocket until I
found a little wooden comb which he always
carried, then I softly tore a fly leaf from the
psalm book, and before I knew it I went 'toot,
toot, toot!' right out there in the meeting.</p>

<p>"I tell you, that was a dreadful minute!"
said Grandma, looking sober, while her audience
giggled. "I hadn't the least idea of making
such a noise. It had never gone very well for
me before, and I was as much astonished as any
one could be to hear it sound out like that. The
minister stopped in the middle of his sentence
and looked at me with a solemn face. Father
set me down hard on the seat, and mother's face
turned the color of the red roses which were
looking in at the side window. Of course they
took the comb and the psalm leaf away, and it
frightened me to think they went in my father's
pocket. I knew I should hear more of it.
After that I sat pretty still, but I did not dare
to raise my eyes to the minister's face.</p>

<p>"I always used to like Sunday afternoon, because
mother told us a story, and grandfather
took us a walk through our own home fields and
had always something sweet and interesting to
tell us. First, though, we went to grandfather's
room right after dinner, and each told all we
could remember about the church service. I
generally had my little story to tell, young as I
was. Sometimes it was only a line of a hymn,
or a little piece of the text, or maybe one
sentence in the prayer. On this Sunday I had
not a word to tell; try as I would, I could not
recall a line or word. The only thing I could
seem to think of, was that noise I made on the
comb. Father asked the questions instead of
grandfather, and that frightened me, because I
knew father was displeased with me. 'What
was the matter, Ruth?' he asked at last. 'Don't
you think the minister spoke distinctly?' I
thought a minute, then I said I didn't believe he
did; for if he had, I should have remembered a
little bit about it.</p>

<p>"'What do you think the sermon was about?'
he asked. And I said, 'It was about Ahab.'
I don't know what made me say that; only I
had heard a story of Ahab only the Sabbath before,
and he was in my mind. I thought from
father's face that I had guessed right, so when
he asked me for any words in the text, I thought
I would guess again; and I said it was about
Ahab's doing worse than all the rest of the kings.
Then father turned to your uncle Ben, and said,
'Benjamin, you may repeat the text; do it
slowly, that Ruth may see what part she has left
out.' Just think how I felt when Ben repeated,
'So they read in the book in the law of God
distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them
to understand the reading.' I cannot tell you
how ashamed I felt!</p>

<p>"What do you suppose I did! I wanted to
hide my face in mother's lap, and tell her how
sorry I was; if I had done so, it would have
been better for me. Instead, I slipped behind
her chair and ran out of the side door. There
stood the old well with the bucket full of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and the dipper hanging beside it. I felt very
hot, and I thought I would take a drink of
water to cool me; then if father asked why I
run away, I could say I went for a drink of
water. It was an unlucky day for me all around;
what ailed that dipper I never could understand.
Perhaps it was because I had my hat on; I was
swinging that by its elastic when father was
questioning me, so finding I had it in my hand
when I slipped away, I put it on my head, and I
think maybe the dipper hit against its edge; anyway,
what did that water do but stream down
over my starched Sunday dress, and my white
dimity collar; and I never knew it until I drank
my fill!</p>

</div>


<p>"Ben came in search of me, and led me back
into grandfather's room, wet as I was, and struggling
to get free. 'Put her to bed!' said father,
in a voice which I knew must be obeyed. So I
was undressed and laid in my trundle bed, and
all that bright afternoon I had to lie there. My
father wasn't over severe, children."&mdash;Grandma
paused to say this, seeing disapproval in the
eyes of her audience.&mdash;"You see I had been told
not to help myself to a drink from that bucket
because it was set too high for me; so, though I
did not think of it at the time, of course it was
disobedience. Well, I lay there, and the only
occupation I had was to spell out the words of
that text, to repeat to father the next morning.
He sent it up to me all printed out on a card; I
was just beginning to learn to read print, and I
had to work hard, I tell you, to get it learned.
But the worst was the next day. There was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
be a ride on the lake in the afternoon, and I was
to go. When I was all dressed, in my blue and
white, made fresh for the occasion, father came
in, took out of his pocket that dreadful comb,
with the fly leaf of the psalm book wrapped
around it, and said: 'Ruth, your mother and I
have decided to give you a treat this afternoon
while we are gone for our ride. You are to sit
in this chair by the window, and make music on
this comb; make it as loud and as much as you
want to.'</p>

<p>"And if you'll believe it, they went away on
their ride and left me sitting there!"</p>

<p>The children exclaimed over this, and Marion
ventured to say she had no idea that Great-grandfather
Wells could be so cruel; she was
sure dear Grandfather Burton would never do
such a thing; and as for papa, he <i>never</i> could.</p>

<p>"Cruel!" said Grandma Burton, with a flash
in her eyes which made them look like Marion's.
"Never you call him that; a better father never
lived in the world; only times are changed, that
is all. Mind you this: I never misbehaved in
church again; and I could always repeat the real
text, after that, instead of stopping to make one
up."</p>

<h2>WALTER TAYLOR'S FAULT.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-w.jpg" width="127" height="135" alt="W" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">WALTER talked too much. He
was simply irrepressible. He
could never keep anything to himself
either of own affairs or of the
affairs of other people; either of his
own opinions or what he might
know or guess of the opinions of others. No
secret was safe with him. Even family affairs
took occasional airings through this propensity
for talking too much. This one fault was likely
to bring Walter into no end of trouble first and
last, and, what was worse, to bring other people
into trouble. One does not like to be obliged to
be always on guard lest some private affair slip
out in the presence of a boy or girl who will set
it flying through the town. Mr. Taylor sometimes
found his business sadly interfered within
this way.</div>

<p>One instance will illustrate; a neighbor had
a piece of land to sell. It was not valuable
land, but Mr. Taylor wanted it because if anyone
bought it for a building spot it would cut
off the view of the lake from the front piazza,
and Mr. Taylor very indiscreetly remarked in
Walter's presence, "I shall buy that corner at
any price, for it is worth a great deal more to
me than to anyone else."</p>

<p>On his way to school Walter stopped to look
at what he already counted a part of the home
grounds. He was planning rows of trees, and
gravel walks, when the owner came along and
entered into conversation. Walter was ready
to talk, and desirous of telling what he knew,
and very early in the conversation he said,
"Father means to buy this corner."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes; he says he will have it at any price,
for it is worth a great deal more to him than to
anyone else; so he means to bid on it to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Well, we shall give him a chance," said the
owner, laughing. And as he walked on he
secretly thanked Walter for that bit of information.
To Mr. Taylor's surprise, he found another
apparently anxious bidder the next day,
and he found himself forced either to pay an
exorbitant price or relinquish the idea of becoming
the owner of the lot. Before he had fully
decided to do the latter, his rival stopped bidding
and the lot was struck off to him at three
times its real value. The former owner chuckled
over what he called his "good luck," and though
Mr. Taylor wondered a little, he never knew
that his boy's folly in repeating a careless remark
of his own, had cost him so dear in giving his
unscrupulous neighbor the opportunity of taking
an unfair advantage.</p>

<p>Another time Walter spoiled a surprise which
his father and mother meant to give his sister.</p>

<p>"You'd better hurry home from school to-night,"
he said that morning as they neared the
academy.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Ella.</p>

<p>"O, nothing! only it is my advice to get home
as quick as you can, and see what is going on."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You'll find out!"</p>

<p>"Are we going to have company?"</p>

<p>"Company? Well, yes&mdash;I don't know but it
might be called company&mdash;a sort of dumb companion&mdash;well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
no&mdash;you couldn't call it dumb
either."</p>

<p>"Walter Taylor! is it something father and
mother do not want me to know?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how they will help your knowing."</p>

<p>"I believe you are letting out a secret and I
will not listen! I should think folks would
learn not to tell you any secrets."</p>

<p>"They didn't tell me. I heard a man tell
father that it had come."</p>

<p>Ella Taylor failed in her recitations that morning
for the first time during the quarter. Her
thoughts were at home, in the parlor; she knew
exactly where <i>it</i> ought to stand and wondered
if they would put it in the right place. She
tried to study, but Walter's hints which were
too plain to be misunderstood insisted upon
crowding themselves into her mind.</p>

<p>"Come in, Ella!" her mother called from the
parlor as Ella was hanging her hat and wraps in
the hall. Ella obeyed the call with flushed cheeks.
She could not feign a surprise which she did not
feel, and she stood embarrassed and uncertain
what to do for a moment, then burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Poor child! the surprise is too much for
her," said her father.</p>

<p>"It isn't that," said Ella; "I tried to be surprised
and I couldn't, that is why I cried."</p>

<p>"Did you know about it?" asked Mr. Taylor.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; Walter told me this morning, and
I was so glad, I could not study at all."</p>

<p>Mr. Taylor turned towards Walter who began
to excuse himself.</p>

<p>"I never said a word about a piano!"</p>

<p>"But you said enough for me to guess," said
Ella. "I tried not to know," she added, turning
to her parents, "but I could not help it.
But don't blame Walter. He didn't think."</p>

<p>"I do blame him," said Mr. Taylor sternly.
"Walter, will you never have any regard for
other people's property? You have no more
right to dispose of other's secrets than you have
to dispose of their money! If you took five
dollars from my desk you would be a thief. But
what do you call yourself when you take my
secrets and use them to gratify your love of talking?
I sometimes wonder if you will ever have
a lesson severe enough to cure you of this fault.
Now you have spoiled this little surprise which
we had planned and given Ella an uneasy day."</p>

<p>"I am sure I did not mean to tell her; I only
wanted to tease her a little."</p>

<p>"You wanted to let her know that you possessed
knowledge which she did not, I suppose.
Or rather I presume you simply wanted to talk.
My boy, if you would learn to regard the secrets
of others and also to reserve your own opinions
now and then, you would save yourself and your
friends much mortification."</p>

<p>Meantime Ella had dried her tears and was
now ready to try the new piano, but Walter was
too chagrined to enjoy music, and went up to
his own room saying within himself, "I wonder
if I can never learn to hold my tongue!"</p>

<p>"By thy words shalt thou be justified, and by
thy words shalt thou be condemned."</p>

<p>Just when he had read or learned those words
Walter did not know, but they came into his
mind suddenly. He supposed they were in the
Bible, but he thought it queer that he should
have remembered them just then. And as he
repeated them he thought, "I suppose that
means that if one's words are wrong or foolish,
he is condemned&mdash;that makes solemn business
of talking!"</p>

<h2>HAPPINESS.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE idea has been transmitted from generation
to generation, that happiness is one
large and beautiful precious stone, a single gem
so rare that all search after it is vain, all effort
for it hopeless. It is not so. Happiness is
a mosaic, composed of many smaller stones.
Each taken apart and viewed singly, may be of
little value, but when all are grouped together
and judiciously combined and set, they form a
pleasing and graceful whole&mdash;a costly jewel.
Trample not under foot, then, the little pleasures
which a gracious Providence scatters in
the daily path, and which, in eager search after
some great and exciting joy, we are apt to overlook.
Why should we keep our eyes fixed on the
distant horizon, while there are so many lovely
roses in the garden in which we are permitted to
walk? The very ardor of our chase after happiness
may be the reason she so often eludes our
grasp. We pantingly strain after her when she
has been graciously brought nigh unto us.</div>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i2.jpg" width="70" height="117" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">I DARE say some of you think Nettie
Decker was a very silly girl to care so
much because her dress was a blue and
white gingham instead of being all
white.</div>

<p>You have told your friend Katie about the
story and asked her if she didn't think it was
real silly to make such an ado over <i>clothes</i>; you
have said you were sure you would just as soon
wear a blue gingham as not if it was clean and
neat. But now let me venture a hint. I
shouldn't be surprised if that was because you
never do have to go to places differently dressed
from all the others. Because if you did, you
would know that it was something of a trial.
Oh! I don't say it is the hardest thing in the
world; or that one is all ready to die as a martyr
who does it; but what I <i>do</i> say is, that it
takes a little moral courage; and, for one, I am
not surprised that Nettie looked very sober
about it when the afternoon came.</p>

<p>It took her a good while to dress; not that
there was so much to be done, but she stopped
to think. With her hair in her neck, still unbraided,
she pinned a lovely pink rose at her
breast just to see how pretty it would look for a
minute. Miss Sherrill had left it for her to
wear; but she did not intend to wear it, because
she thought it would not match well with her
gingham dress. Just here, I don't mind owning
that I think her silly; because I believe that
sweet flowers go with sweet pure young faces,
whether the dress is of gingham or silk.</p>

<p>But Nettie looked grave, as I said, and wished
it was over; and tried to plan for the hundredth
time, how it would all be. The girls, Cecelia
Lester and Lorena Barstowe and the rest of
them, would be out in their elegant toilets, and
would look at her so! That Ermina Farley
would be there; she had seen her but once, on
the first Sunday, and liked her face and her ways
a little better than the others; but she had been
away since then. Jerry said she was back, however,
and Mrs. Smith said they were the richest
folks in town; and of course Ermina would be
elegantly dressed at the flower party.</p>

<p>Well, she did not care. She was willing to
have them all dressed beautifully; she was not
mean enough to want them to wear gingham
dresses, if only they would not make fun of hers.
Oh! if she could <i>only</i> stay at home, and help
iron, and get supper, and fry some potatoes
nicely for father, how happy she would be. Then
she sighed again, and set about braiding her
hair. She meant to go, but she could not help
being sorry for herself to think it must be done;
and she spent a great deal of trouble in trying
to plan just how hateful it would all be; how
the girls would look, and whisper, and giggle;
and how her cheeks would burn. Oh dear!</p>

<p>Then she found it was late, and had to make
her fingers fly, and to rush about the little wood-house
chamber which was still her room, in a
way which made Sarah Ann say to her mother
with a significant nod, "I guess she's woke up
and gone at it, poor thing!" Yes, she had;
and was down in fifteen minutes more.</p>

<p>Oh! but didn't the little girls look pretty!
Nettie forgot her trouble for a few minutes, in
admiring them when she had put the last touches
to their toilet. Susie was to be in a tableau
where she would need a dolly, and Miss Sherrill
had furnished one for the occasion. A lovely
dolly with real hair, and blue eyes, and a bright
blue sash to match them; and when Susie got it
in her arms, there came such a sweet, softened
look over her face that Nettie hardly knew her.
The sturdy voice, too, which was so apt to be
fierce, softened and took a motherly tone; the
dolly was certainly educating Susie. Little Sate
looked on, interested, pleased, but without the
slightest shade of envy. She wanted no dolly;
or, if she did, there was a little black-faced,
worn, rag one reposing at this moment in the
trundle bed where little Sate's own head would
rest at night; kissed, and caressed, and petted,
and told to be good until mamma came back;
this dolly had all of Sate's warm heart. For
the rest, the grave little old women in caps and
spectacles, which wound about her dress, crept
up in bunches on her shoulders, lay in nestling
heaps at her breast, filled all Sate's thoughts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
She seemed to have become a little old woman
herself, so serious and womanly was her face.</p>

<p>Nettie took a hand of each, and they went to
the flower festival. There was to be a five
o'clock tea for all the elderly people of the
church, and the tables, some of them, were set
in Mr. Eastman's grounds, which adjoined the
church. When Nettie entered these grounds
she found a company of girls several years
younger than herself, helping to decorate the
tables with flowers; at least that was their work,
but as Nettie appeared at the south gate, a queer
little object pushed in at the west side. A child
not more than six years old, with a clean face,
and carefully combed hair, but dressed in a plain
dark calico; and her pretty pink toes were without
shoes or stockings.</p>

<p>I am not sure that if a little wolf had suddenly
appeared before them, it could not have caused
more exclamations of astonishment and dismay.</p>

<p>"Only look at that child!" "The idea!"
"Just to think of such a thing!" are a few of
the exclamations with which the air was thick.
At last, one bolder than the rest, stepped towards
her: "Little girl, where did you come
from? What in the world do you want here?"</p>

<p>Startled by the many eyes and the sharp
tones, the small new-comer hid her face behind
an immense bunch of glowing hollyhocks, which
she held in her hand, and said not a word.
Then the chorus of voices became more eager:</p>

<p>"Do look at her hollyhocks! Did ever anybody
see such a queer little fright! Girls, I do
believe she has come to the party." Then the
one who had spoken before, tried again: "See
here, child, whoever you are, you must go right
straight home; this is no place for you. I wonder
what your mother was about&mdash;if you have
one&mdash;to let you run away barefooted, and
looking like a fright."</p>

<p>Now the barefooted maiden was thoroughly
frightened, and sobbed outright. It was precisely
what Nettie Decker needed to give her
courage. When she came in at the gate, she
had felt like shrinking away from all eyes;
now she darted an indignant glance at the
speaker, and moved quickly toward the crying
child, Susie and Sate following close behind.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, little girl," she said in the gentlest
tones, stooping and putting an arm tenderly
around the trembling form; "you haven't
done anything wrong; Miss Sherrill will be
here soon, and she will make it all right."</p>

<p>Thus comforted, the tears ceased, and the
small new-comer allowed her hand to be taken;
while Susie came around to her other side, and
scowled fiercely, as though to say: "I'll protect
this girl myself; let's see you touch her now!"</p>

<p>A burst of laughter greeted Nettie as soon
as she had time to give heed to it. Others had
joined the groups, among them Lorena Barstow
and Irene Lewis. "What's all this?"
asked Irene.</p>

<p>"O, nothing," said one; "only that Decker
girl's sister, or cousin, or something has just
arrived from Cork, and come in search of her.
Lorena Barstow, did you ever see such a queer-looking
fright?"</p>

<p>"I don't see but they look a good deal alike,"
said Lorena, tossing her curls; "I'm sure their
dresses correspond; is she a sister?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," answered one of the smaller
girls; "those two cunning little things in white
are Nettie Decker's sisters; I think they are
real sweet."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Lorena, giving them a disagreeable
stare, "in white, are they? The unselfish
older sister has evidently cut up her nightgowns
to make them white dresses for this occasion."</p>

<p>"Lorena," said the younger girl, "if I were
you I would be ashamed; mother would not
like you to talk in that way."</p>

<p>"Well, you see Miss Nanie, you are not me,
therefore you cannot tell what you would be,
or do; and I want to inform you it is not your
business to tell me what mother would like."</p>

<p>Imagine Nettie Decker standing quietly, with
the barefooted child's small hand closely
clasped in hers, listening to all this! There was
a pretense of lowered voices, yet every word
was distinct to her ears. Her heart beat fast
and she began to feel as though she really was
paying quite a high price for the possibility of
getting Norm into the church parlor for a few
minutes that evening.</p>

<p>At that moment, through the main gateway,
came Ermina Farley, a colored man with her,
bearing a basket full of such wonderful roses,
that for a minute the group could only exclaim
over them. Ermina was in white, but her dress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
was simply made, and looked as though she
might not be afraid to tumble about on the
grass in it; her shoes were thick, and the blue
sash she wore, though broad and handsome, had
some way a quiet air of fitness for the occasion,
which did not seem to belong to most of the
others. She watched the disposal of her roses,
then gave an inquiring glance about the grounds
as she said, "What are you all doing here?"</p>

<p>"We are having a tableau," said Lorena Barstow.
"Look behind you, and you will see
the Misses Bridget and Margaret Mulrooney,
who have just arrived from ould Ireland shure."</p>

<p>Most of the thoughtless girls laughed, mistaking
this rudeness for wit, but Ermina turned
quickly and caught her first glimpse of Nettie's
burning face; then she hastened toward her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 507px;">
<img src="images/illus26.jpg" width="507" height="392" alt="girls at a party" />
<div class="caption">"ONLY LOOK AT THAT CHILD!"</div>
</div>

<p>"Why, here is little Prudy, after all," she
said eagerly; "I coaxed her mother to let her
come, but I didn't think she would. Has Miss
Sherrill seen her? I think she will make such a
cunning Roman flower-girl, in that tableau, you
know. Her face is precisely the shape and
style of the little girls we saw in Rome last winter.
Poor little girlie, was she frightened?
How kind you were to take care of her. She
is a real bright little thing. I want to coax her
into Sunday-school if I can. Let us go and ask
Miss Sherrill what she thinks about the flower-girl."</p>

<p>How fast Ermina Farley could talk! She
did not wait for replies. The truth was, Nettie's
glowing cheeks, and Susie's fierce looks,
told her the story of trial for somebody else
besides the Roman flower-girl; she could guess
at things which might have been said before she
came. She wound her arm familiarly about
Nettie's waist as she spoke, and drew her, almost
against her will, across the lawn. "My!"
said Irene Lewis. "How good we are!"</p>

<p>"Birds of a feather flock together," quoted
Lorena Barstow. "I think that barefooted
child and her protector look alike."</p>

<p>"Still," said Irene, "you must remember
that Ermina Farley has joined that flock; and
her feathers are very different."</p>

<p>"Oh! that is only for effect," was the naughty
reply, with another toss of the rich curls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Now what was the matter with all these disagreeable
young people? Did they really attach
so much importance to the clothes they wore
as to think no one was respectable who was
not dressed like them? Had they really no
hearts, so that it made no difference to them
how deeply they wounded poor Nettie Decker?</p>

<p>I do not think it was quite either of these
things. They had been, so far in their lives,
unfortunate, in that they had heard a great deal
about dress, and style, until they had done what
young people and a few older ones are apt to
do, attached too much importance to these
things. They were neither old enough, nor
wise enough, to know that it is a mark of a shallow
nature to judge of people by the clothes
they wear; then, in regard to the ill-natured
things said, I tell you truly, that even Lorena
Barstow was ashamed of herself. When her
younger sister reproved her, the flush which
came on her cheek was not all anger, much of it
was shame. But she had taught her tongue to
say so many disagreeable words, and to pride
itself on its independence in saying what
she pleased, that the habit asserted itself,
and she could not seem to control it. The contrast
between her own conduct and Ermina
Farley's struck her so sharply and disagreeably
it served only to make her worse than before;
precisely the effect which follows when people
of uncontrolled tempers find themselves rebuked.</p>

<p>Half-way down the lawn the party in search
of Miss Sherrill met her face to face. Her
greeting was warm. "Oh! here is my dear
little grandmother. Thank you, Nettie, for
coming; I look to you for a great deal of help
this afternoon. Why, Ermina, what wee mousie
have you here?"</p>

<p>"She is a little Roman flower-girl, Miss Sherrill;
they live on Parker street. Her mother
is a nice woman; my mother has her to run the
machine. I coaxed her to let Trudie wear her
red dress and come barefoot, until you would
see if she would do for the Roman flower-girl.
Papa says her face is very Roman in style, and
she always makes us think of the flower-girls
we saw there. I brought my Roman sash to
dress her in, if you thought well of it; she is
real bright, and will do just as she is told."</p>

<p>"It is the very thing," said Miss Sherrill with
a pleased face; "I am so glad you thought of
it. And the hollyhocks are just red enough to
go in the basket. Did you think of them too?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am; mamma did. She said the
more red flowers we could mass about her, the
better for a Roman peasant."</p>

<p>"It will be a lovely thing," said Miss Sherrill.
Then she stooped and kissed the small brown
face, which was now smiling through its tears.
"You have found good friends, little one. She
is very small to be here alone. Ermina, will you
and Nettie take care of her this afternoon, and
see that she is happy?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Ermina promptly. "Nettie
was taking care of her when I came. She was
afraid at first, I think."</p>

<p>"They were ugly to her," volunteered Susie,
"they were just as ugly to her as they could be;
they made her cry. If they'd done it to Sate I
would have scratched them and bit them."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Miss Sherrill sorrowfully. "How
sorry I am to hear it; then Susie would have
been naughty too, and it wouldn't have made
the others any better; in fact, it would have
made them worse."</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Susie, but she did care.
She said that, just as you do sometimes, when
you mean you care a great deal, and don't want
to let anybody know it. For the first time,
Susie reflected whether it was a good plan to
scratch and bite people who did not, in her
judgment, behave well. It had not been a
perfect success in her experience, she was
willing to admit that; and if it made Miss
Sherrill sorry, it was worth thinking about.</p>

<p>Well, that afternoon which began so dismally,
blossomed out into a better time than Nettie
had imagined it possible for her to have. To
be sure those particular girls who had been the
cause of her sorrow, would have nothing to do
with her; and whispered, and sent disdainful
glances her way when they had opportunity;
but Nettie went in their direction as little as
possible, and when she did was in such a hurry
that she sometimes forgot all about them. Miss
Sherrill, who was chairman of the committee
of entertainment, kept her as busy as a bee the
entire afternoon; running hither and thither,
carrying messages to this one, and pins to that
one, setting this vase of flowers at one end, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
that lovely basket at another, and, a great deal
of the time; standing right beside Miss Sherrill
herself, handing her, at call, just what she
needed when she dressed the girls with their
special flowers. She could hear the bright
pleasant talk which passed between Miss Sherrill
and the other young ladies. She was often
appealed to with a pleasant word. Her own
teacher smiled on her more than once, and said
she was the handiest little body who had ever
helped them; and all the time that lovely Ermina
Farley with her beautiful hair, and her
pretty ways, and her sweet low voice, was near
at hand, joining in everything which she had
to do. To be sure she heard, in one of her rapid
scampers across the lawn, this question asked
in a loud tone by Lorena Barstow: "I wonder
how much they pay that girl for running
errands? Maybe she will earn enough to get
herself a new white nightgown to wear to parties;"
but at that particular minute, Ermina
Farley running from another direction on an
errand precisely like her own, bumped up
against her with such force that their noses
ached; then both stopped to laugh merrily, and
some way, what with the bump, and the laughter,
Nettie forgot to cry, when she had a chance,
over the unkind words. Then, later in the
afternoon, came Jerry; and in less than five
minutes he joined their group, and made himself
so useful that when Mr. Sherrill came presently
for boys to go with him to the chapel to
arrange the tables, Miss Sherrill said in low
tones, "Don't take Jerry please, we need him
here." Nettie heard it, and beamed her satisfaction.
Also she heard Irene Lewis say,
"Now they've taken that Irish boy into their
crowd&mdash;shouldn't you think Ermina Farley
would be ashamed!"</p>

<p>Then Nettie's face fairly paled. It is one
thing to be insulted yourself; it is another to
stand quietly by and see your friends insulted.
She was almost ready to appeal to Miss Sherrill
for protection from tongues. But Jerry heard
the same remark, and laughed; not in a forced
way, but actually as though it was very amusing
to him. And almost immediately he called out
something to Ermina, using an unmistakable
Irish brogue. What was the use in trying to
protect a boy who was so indifferent as that?</p>

<h2>AT THE CLOCK TINKER'S.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a2.jpg" width="72" height="114" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">AS we were clearing out the attic last
spring we came across an old clock;
one of those old-fashioned high clocks
that had been hidden away in that dark
corner of the attic many years. Not that
we didn't know of its existence; every annual
housecleaning it had been remarked upon; but
last spring Tom said, "See here, Nell; don't
you know these old clocks are all the rage?"</div>

<p>"Yes, I know, but that old thing won't go."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"I don't, only I should suppose if it hadn't
been past its usefulness, Grandfather Bradley
would not have bought a new one in its place."</p>

<p>"O, people do not always use things until they
are worn out; did I not hear you tell aunt Mary
that our centre-table looked so shabby and old-fashioned
that although it was strong and not
broken at all you intended to send it to the attic
and have a new one? Now I suppose that either
aunt Mary or aunt Charlotte thought the same
thing about the old clock, and when some 'Yankee
peddler' came along with a new-fashioned
Connecticut clock, they coaxed grandfather to
buy one and sent this old one to this dark corner.
Now I am going to investigate." Indeed Tom
was soon ready to report. "See here, Nell!
I believe that the old thing only needs cleaning
and oiling to put it in running order. Let's take
it down to Lampson and see what can be done."</p>

<p>By this time I was interested; to have that
old clock down in the hall would be to excite the
wonder, admiration and envy of the neighborhood.
The old man laughed when he saw it.</p>

<p>"I remember that clock. I sold your grandfather
the one which took its place. I was a
young fellow then, and I remember that your
aunts wanted a new clock while the old gentleman
thought the old one was good enough; but
the girls always had their way with their father.
I have wondered about this old clock lately and
meant to try to get hold of it and make my fortune
out of it;" and the old man laughed heartily;
"but you young ones have got the start of me.
Yes, it is all right; I can make it run about as
well as ever. It will outlast half a dozen modern
clocks. Thirty years? Yes, more'n that. It's
nigher fifty years since I used to sell clocks, hereabouts.
Well, changes have come about that
would astonish one to know, since then.</p>

<p>"Tom," said the old man suddenly, after a
pause in which his thoughts seemed busy with
the past, "when I was a young fellow like you
I did not think that at seventy I should be just
an old tinker; there's a place over across the
river that used to just suit my fancy and it was
my ambition to get rich enough to buy it and
take a sweet girl I knew in those days over there
and live out my time, growing old, respected and
looked up to as your grandfather was. Do you
know why I failed? My boy, I threw away just
thirty years of my life! That is why I failed.
Your father can tell you how he has seen me
reeling through the streets in those days. There
were half a dozen of us fellows and I am the only
one left&mdash;the only one who has escaped a
drunkard's grave. And I have only just escaped.
It was after I had squandered my money,
broken my wife's heart, made my children outcasts
and ruined my health that I was saved.
All the rest went down, drinking to the last. I
tell you, my boy, never touch it! <i>Never tamper
with temptation!</i> Yes, I can fix the old clock
and make it run about as well as ever, but you
can't mend up an old drunkard and make him
tell off the remaining hours of his life with any
certainty. Whiskey somehow uses up the inside
works and it is a poor sort of a service that a
worn-out old rum drinker can render his Master.
And Tom, I say, let rum alone! And Nellie,
don't have anything to do with a young fellow
that will not sign a pledge!"</p>

<p>The old clock adorns our lower hall, is much
looked at and admired; but to Tom and me,
every stroke as it tells off the hours comes as a
warning voice, and we seem to hear the old man
saying, "Never tamper with temptation."</p>

<h2>WHERE I WENT, AND WHAT I SAW.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-n.jpg" width="73" height="95" alt="N" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">NOT a long journey this time. It was a
bright Sabbath afternoon, and I walked
own Gilbert avenue, then McMillan
avenue, then Kibbe street, until I came
to a large new building into which all the world
seemed to be trying to crowd. We were late;
the sound of many voices in song made us try to
hasten, but the crowd was so great that this was
not easy to do. On the way, Sabbath though it
was, we had passed many crowds of a different
sort. Men and women pushing into street cars,
talking loud and laughing gayly, on their way to
park, or garden, or theatre. On the corners
were crowds of boys, talking, spitting, swearing;
we passed saloons out of which reeled drunken
men; in short, we passed places and people
which did not make us think of Sunday at all.
But this was different. The singing was very
sweet; the room was large, and had many windows;
the walls were white, and everything was
fresh and new. The floor was carpeted, and
seated with chairs, and every chair was filled;
so also were the aisles, and the doorways leading
into the side rooms. But the great evergreen
letters on the space opposite the main door,
said&mdash;</div>

<div class='center'>
WELCOME.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>And the ushers came forward cordially and
motioned us in, saying cheerily, "Always room
here for one more." So we elbowed and wedged
our way.</div>

<p>What was going on? Why, this was the
dedication of Bethany Chapel, the room for
which the young men and the young women up
on these Hills have been working for years.
Yesterday it was in order. On the wall hung a
motto at which everybody looked and smiled.
It was a very pretty motto:</p>

<div class='center'>
FAITH IN ACTION.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Those were the words; and looking about the
pretty room, one could not help feeling that
there must have been a good deal of it in action
to have given us such results. But I noticed
that people looked beyond the motto at the nail
from which it hung. A gold nail! Very large,
and entirely covered with gold. That was
certainly a new kind of nail. I wondered what
it meant; presently the superintendent of the
school told us about it. It seems that, a long
time before, the teachers had explained to their
scholars just what was to be done, and just how
much money, and time, and work, it would take,
and how much help would be needed. Among
others, the primary teacher had explained very
carefully to her little bits, and had said: "Now
we all want to help; every little girl and every
little boy must do something; I am sure you
each want a nail in the new building. Don't
you?"</div>

<p>Then of course every one of them said "Yes,
ma'am," in their eager little voices; and then I
suppose some of them went home and forgot all
about it. Not so little Faith whose story I am
going to tell you. She thought it over, fixing
all the powers of her mind on it. She talked it
over with her particular friend Robbie, as he
worked with the scissors and a sheet of paper
trying to cut a pattern for a new kind of cart
wheel which he intended to make.</p>

<p>How should she get a nail to put in the new
Sunday-school room? It ought to be a <i>very</i> big
nail, Robbie," she explained. "Because, you
see, I should want it to help hold something;
and I should want it to hold real hard, or else I
would be ashamed of it."</p>

<p>Robbie agreed, but was too busy with his
wheel to say much. "And where do you s'pose
I could get one?" said Faith. "If I only had
some money I could buy a great big one; but I
haven't a single cent."</p>

<p>It took days of thinking and planning, and
hunting, but at last, oh, joy! Faith found the
object of her desire; a great big nail! Very
rusty and a trifle bent, but so large that it filled
her heart with delight. Never was a happier
maiden than the one who carried the precious
nail to her teacher, all neatly wrapped in paper.
Some of the scholars laughed, and said it was
not good for anything; but that was because
they did not know any better. That blessed
superintendent did not laugh. He received the
gift with smiles and thanks, and he took it down
town and had it straightened, and covered with
gold; so that the unsightly rusty thing glowed
with beauty, and then it was used to hold the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
motto; and is to fill its place in Bethany Chapel
so long as the building stands. Will anybody
say little Faith did not do what she could?</p>

<p>But I want to tell you about the meeting.
There were many speeches and much singing.
When Doctor Hays began to speak, all the little
children straightened themselves and made
ready to listen; there was something in his
voice which made them think he was worth listening
to.</p>

<p>"Children," he began, "how many know
what I have in my hand?" Hundreds of voices
answered that he had a watch.</p>

<p>"Is there anything about it in the Bible?"</p>

<p>This they did not know; so he told them he
wanted them to be sure to remember his text,
for it was that one word, "Watch," and they
would find it in Mark, thirteenth chapter and
last verse. He had quite a time getting them
to remember where it was, and they laughed a
little at their mistakes; but at last I think every
boy and girl there could give it correctly. He
had a good deal to say about a watch; how the
"little fellow" inside of it worked away all day
and all night, and day after day, never stopping
to fret because it had so much to do; never resolving
that it would begin to-morrow morning
and do great things, and being content because
of that resolve to do nothing, for awhile; it just
worked away, a tick at a time. Then he said
there were three things he wanted to tie to their
memories by the help of that watch. First,
they were to watch for scholars for their Sabbath-school.
Every boy and girl there ought to
be on the watch for those who went nowhere
else, and nab them.</p>

<p>Second, they were to be on the watch against
sin. He knew a very little boy who once prayed
this prayer: "Dear Lord, make Satan look just
like Satan every time he comes after me, so I
will know who he is, and fight." That was a
good prayer, said Doctor Hays. "You see to it
that you know who Satan is, every time, when
he comes after you. When he comes whining
to you that it isn't a very bad thing to hang
around the street corners, and play, or to disobey
your mother, or to tell what isn't true, say
to him '<i>You are Satan</i>: I know you; and I
am not going to have anything to do with you.'"</p>

<p>Thirdly, they were to be on the watch for
opportunities to do good. There was a very
earnest little talk about that, which I have not
room for; and besides, I cannot tell it as Doctor
Hays said it; I wish I could. But the three
heads to his sermon I remember, because of the
watch on which he hung them. What made
him think of the watch? Because, when the
disciples of Jesus were talking with him, one
day, he said that word, not only for his disciples,
but for you and me: "And what I say unto you,
I say unto <i>all, watch</i>." And after he was
through talking with them, he went to Bethany.
So as the new school was named Bethany, the
doctor thought the scholars would remember his
sermon and text better if he told it in that way.</p>

<p>There were some little boys and girls who recited
Bible verses about the House of the Lord,
each bringing an evergreen letter which commenced
their verse, and when the letters were
hung on the wire waiting for them, they spelled</p>

<div class='center'>
OUR SABBATH-SCHOOL.<br />
</div>

<p>I began to copy the verses for you. Then I
decided not to do any such thing. I said: I
will tell the Pansies about it, and ask them to
hunt out verses for themselves which will spell
the same; verses that they think would fit their
Sabbath-school, or describe what their lives
ought to be, or that they like very much, for
some reason. Then they will have an acrostic
of verses of their own. How many will do it?
What is the use of our going to so many places
together, if we don't learn some new nice things
to do when we get home?</p>

<h2>"OLD SNOOKS."</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THUS the boys built of the snow what
they pleased. Sometimes it was "Old
Snooks." He was the village drunkard,
with a big brandy nose and ragged
coat.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 410px;">
<img src="images/illus41.jpg" width="410" height="352" alt="boys building a snowman" />
<div class="caption">THE BOYS AT WORK.</div>
</div>

<p>When it was done and declared to be a good
likeness, each fellow armed himself with snowballs,
and, standing a little way off, the command
was given to fire, and "Old Snooks" received
a merciless pelting, one ball hitting him
squarely in the eye, another on the nose, another
knocking off an ear, until the image was completely
demolished amid shouts of triumph.</p>

<p>Then somebody else was set up for a mark.
But usually the most fun was in building a fort
and laying siege to it&mdash;or rather storming and
taking it.</p>

<p>Once the real "Old Snooks" himself came
staggering by while the boys were raising the
breastworks. He stopped a moment to swear
as he usually did, when one of the little "rascals"
took deliberate aim and fired, and Snooks'
old hat was lifted into the air and landed over
the fence into a big snowbank.</p>

<p>Now when the boys saw the rage of the old
man, and that he was making for them as fast
as his poor legs would let him, away they ran.
But all that night and the next day they trembled
and kept out of the way, fearing the wrath
of Old Snooks.</p>

<p>The wretched man found it easier to catch
his hat than scampering boys. So he gave up
the chase and urged his
way homeward.</p>

<p>But the track was drifted,
and his limbs chilled.
Soon he fell, but was picked
up by a passing neighbor
and carried to his miserable
home.</p>

<p>Not long after the village
bell tolled for his
funeral. Those boys were
thoroughly sobered when
they remembered that their
fun had something to do
with Old Snooks' death;
so they resolved that, whatever
they did, they would
never find pleasure again
over the misery or sin of
any one.</p>

<p>One day when their snow
fortress was done and besiegers
and besieged
were about to see which
party was master of the situation, several of
General Gage's soldiers came along. This was
more than one hundred years ago, and the "village"
was Boston; the playground Boston
Common; Gage, the British general in command.
It was a time when almost every American
man, woman and child, was "mad" at
England because of taxes or the "Stamp Act."</p>

<p>The wise old men said with an ominous shake
of the head that trouble was coming. The boys
heard it and began to talk war and "play soldier."
They were at it now. Those in the fort
were "British;" those about to storm it,
"Americans."</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 456px;">
<img src="images/illus44.jpg" width="456" height="554" alt="boys playing in snow" />
<div class="caption">THEIR PLAYGROUND.</div>
</div>
<p>The passing soldiers heard the words, "Drive
the Britishers out;" "shoot them;" "kill the
tyrants." Though it was all in play, the words
stung them, and coming suddenly upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
boys, they handled them roughly, calling them
"young rebels," and demolishing the fort.</p>

<p>This did not make the boys less "rebel."
They spread the news of their bad treatment
by General Gage's soldiers. Teachers, parents,
everybody, was angry.</p>

<p>The next day a procession of boys, headed
by one of the
"storming party,"
marched
through the
Common and
halted before
General Gage's
headquarters.
Three of the
number were admitted
to his
presence and
asked what it all
meant. Nothing
frightened by
being surrounded
by officers,
glittering with
armor, the young
"captain," looking
the great general
full in the
face, recounted
the affair about
the destroying
of their fort by
the soldiers.</p>

<p>General Gage
patiently heard
the statement
and promised to
reprove his men
and see their
sport should not
be spoiled again
in that way.</p>

<p>So the procession departed in triumph. The
boys were no more molested.</p>

<p>But the Revolution soon came on, and
instead of snowballs and snow forts and the
sport of children, there were musket balls and
roaring cannon, there were stone forts and
"banners rolled in blood."</p>

<p>Seven years of war followed, in which the
sword, the bayonet, the bullet, fire and famine,
played their awful part, and&mdash;"the Britishers"
went home to England.</p>

<p>America was free!</p>

<p>How many of those boys who snowballed
"Old Snooks" and visited General Gage became
Congressmen, I have never heard. Yet
I dare say some of them got into the high
places of the new nation.</p>



<p>But one of the best "resolutions" ever passed
was theirs:</p>

<p>Never to have fun at the expense of such
creatures as "Old Snooks."</p>

<h2>MY BRAINLESS ACQUAINTANCE.</h2>



<div class='center'><span class="smcap">By Paranete.</span></div>

<h3>V.&mdash;THE SAD FATE OF AN ENGLISHMAN.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="72" height="95" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">"I CONFESS," the pin went on, "that I
was not sorry I had been brought along.
The beautiful, boundless sea was around
me everywhere. It was exhilarating.
Most people talked about the refreshing odor,
but the sight and sound was enough for me.
And the day that we had the tempest, when
everyone seemed so frightened, I thought it was
delightful to watch the giant waves as they
raised and lowered the ship.</div>

<p>"Finally we reached the shore. I did not
know where we were. We got in a train, and
after a few hours' ride, changed to a carriage,
and drove through the streets. The rest of the
party seemed greatly interested in the signs over
the store doors, but as I had never learned to
read, I saw nothing strange about them. We
reached a large building, and were ushered into
a fine 'suite of rooms.' That was what they
called them. As I was the only pin on the
cushion, my mistress sent for some more, and
soon several were placed with me. From them
I learned that we were in Paris, in the country
of France, though it was with difficulty that
they made me understand, and doubtless we
could not have talked together at all, only they
had met an English pin, who had taught them
some of his language. They were Parisians, as
they told me with much haughtiness, but if they
were, I did not like them for they were very
proud. My dear young friend, if you ever expect
to be agreeable company, you must not be
proud.</p>

<p>"By some chance, a disconsolate-looking, and
acting pin was put on the cushion, after the
Parisians had all gone. He told me he was
English; and gave me the story of his life,
which was a very sad one. He said he did not
care what happened to him now, and that the
first chance he could get, he should make away
with himself. I advised him not to do so, and
tried to console him a little. But it was useless.
He said that without friends, life was but a burden
to him.</p>

<p>"When I told him how I was made into a pin,
he seemed much amazed, and said the wire that he
had been made of had been softened by heating,
and then had been pounded and twisted like a
horseshoe into the right shape. He said that
that was the way with all his former English
friends, and he sighed. Then I was proud (I
confess it) of my country; proud that I was an
American, and did not have to go through all
English pins did! While my creation only
lasted ten seconds, his took many minutes.</p>

<p>"Just as we were discussing the different
methods by which we were made, my mistress
(and his) came into the room, and he hurriedly
said good-by.</p>

<p>"'You will never see me again. She will
take me, and not you. Mine has been a sad life,
and it will have a sad end. I hope that you
will be happy. You are the only one that has
ever tried to comfort me since all my friends
were taken away from me; but you could not.
Good-by!' And with that, my mistress took
him away.</p>

<p>"She went over to the marble basin with the
silver faucets, and turned some water in, while
she held the pin, not very securely, I suppose,
for he tried with all his strength, and gave a
leap into the basin. The water carried him
swiftly through the hole, and he was seen no
more!</p>

<p>"O how I felt! To see one of my own race
go to destruction before my eyes was hard to
bear! I would have wept, but you know that
is impossible to me, but whenever I think of the
sad, sad fate of him with whom I was acquainted,
for so short time, my brassy heart
aches, as it were, and I feel as if I must go and
comfort him, lie he in sewer or sea!"</p>

<p>(Just here the pin seemed much moved, and
trembled so violently that I put my hand on the
edge of the desk, to keep him from falling off.)</p>

<p>Presently he continued: "Let this be a lesson
to you, my dear young friend, never to be
discouraged, whatever be your lot in life, or you
will meet with a sad fate, like my poor acquaintance,
the English pin.</p>

<p>"It must have been for about a week then,
that my life was rather dull. I was sorry for
this; I longed for something to divert my mind
from the sad scene I had witnessed. All I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
do was to gaze disconsolately at the shining
marble basin in the corner of the room, feeling
that it was a sort of tombstone erected over the
body of my friend, and make a solemn resolve
never to become so discouraged with that which
it was my duty to bear, as to desire to put an end
to my existence, but always to bear patiently
the task set before me. And you, my boy, will
find your life much happier, if you make the
same resolve.</p>

<p>"One day while my mistress' little girl was
sitting reading by the window, a gentleman
came in who had made his appearance during
the last few days, and whom the children called
uncle. He invited her to take a walk. She
hastily brushed her hair, and hunting around
for a smaller pin, evidently, took me reluctantly,
to pin her sash with, and hurried down to meet
her uncle, who was waiting at the hotel door;
for that I had learned was the name of the
building.</p>

<p>"They walked along down many streets, until
finally they came to one where stores were.
Into one of these the little girl went, and bought
a paper of pins; as soon as they reached a
quieter street, she took me out, so as to fill my
place with a smaller pin, and would have thrown
me into the gutter, but her uncle stopped her,
saying:</p>

<p>"'Give it to me, if you don't want it. Never
throw away even so small a thing as a pin, my
girl, or you may want one very much, some
day.'</p>

<p>"She laughed, and handed me to him, and he
put me on the inside of his coat. When they
reached home, or rather the hotel, he bade all
the family good-by, and that evening boarded a
train, and travelled till we reached another large
city, where he took a steamer the next day, and
I learned from some of his remarks that he was
going back to America. I was very glad, I can
assure you, for by this time I had grown homesick.
The ride back was just about the same as
the ride away from home had been, the only incident
of any importance, that I remember,
being that my master once fell overboard while
I was on his coat, which was exceedingly disagreeable
for both of us, until the sailors rescued
us, and though I suppose those same brave
men did not even know of my existence, I think
I was really as thankful to them as was my
master.</p>

<p>"When the steamer reached New York, the
gentleman took a train, which, after a few hours'
ride, brought us to a small town, where we
found at the depot a carriage waiting for my
master, with a gentleman in it, who greeted him
warmly.</p>

<p>"During the ride to the stranger's house, he
suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"'Will, my cuff has come unpinned, and the
pin has mysteriously disappeared. Have you
another for me?'</p>

<p>"So my master put his hand to his coat,
where I had been ever since we left Paris, and
gave me to the gentleman. He, of course, fastened
his cuff with me, and I remained in it till
night, when, as he was taking it off when making
ready for bed, he (whom I had so faithfully
served) accidently dropped me from the open
window, and I fell into a crack in the sidewalk!"</p>

<h2>DOES ALCOHOL WARM US?</h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>A PATIENT was arguing with his doctor the
necessity of his taking a stimulant. He
urged that he was weak and needed it. Said
he:</div>

<p>"But, doctor, I <i>must</i> have some kind of a
stimulant. I am cold, and it warms me."</p>

<p>"Precisely," came the doctor's crusty answer.
"See here, this stick is cold," taking up a stick
of wood from the box beside the hearth and
tossing it into the fire, "now it is warm; but is
the stick benefited?"</p>

<p>The sick man watched the wood first send out
little puffs of smoke, and then burst into flame,
and replied: "Of course not: it is burning
itself!"</p>

<p>"And so are you when you warm yourself
with alcohol; you are literally burning up the
delicate tissues of your stomach and brain."</p>

<p>Yes, alcohol will warm you, but who finds the
<i>fuel</i>? When you take food, that is fuel, and as
it burns out, you keep warm. But when you
take alcohol to warm you, you are like a man
who sets his house on fire and warms his fingers
by it as it burns.&mdash;<i>Temperance Banner.</i></p>

<div class="drop-capi2">IT seemed an age to the three frantic passengers
before the train ran into Brigham&mdash;but
it was in reality five minutes
ahead of time. St. George and his
faithful adherent bade good-by with a heavy
heart to Thomas, longing to stay and help him,
but knowing that home they must go. Thomas
tumbled out on the snowy platform more dead
than alive from fear, and realizing that betrayal
of a trust wasn't after all so productive of ease as
it might be thought to be, he gathered himself
up and walked uncertainly to the waiting-room
door; a man standing within eyed him narrowly.</div>

<p>"We don't allow drunken people in here,"
he said coldly, "you'll have to stay outside."</p>

<p>"I ain't drunk," cried Thomas, roused to action;
"I'm blest if I am; I'm only unfortunate."</p>

<p>The man laughed loud and long, and called to
another, "See here; here's a chap got off his
train&mdash;not half seas over, you know, oh no!
only he's unfortunate."</p>

<p>Thomas' face blazed in an instant. That he,
Mr. Bang's man, who had filled one place for a
good dozen years, and was saving and industrious,
with no taste for the company of low-lived
fellows and no leaning toward their habits,
should be brought face to face with one of them
in this unlucky moment of his life when courage
was at its lowest ebb, seemed to him the cruelest
blow of Fate, and it deprived him of what
little remaining sense he had.</p>

<p>"If anyone says that to me again I'll pitch
right into him," he shouted.</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;hurrah! he knows what's what!"
cried the fellow, a stalwart lounger whose only interest
had been in seeing the train come in and
depart. When that was over, he had nothing
else for his active mind to work upon, and he
hailed with delight this new excitement. "Come
on, fellows, this chap is <i>de</i>termined to fight. So
we won't disappoint him. You're a drunken,
good-for-nothing sot," he cried in Thomas' face.</p>

<p>Thomas gave one plunge and struck the quarrelsome
man squarely in the face.</p>

<p>"Take that, and that, and that," he cried, beside
himself in a passion. Never in his life engaged
in a quarrel involving blows, now that he
was in one, it was purely delicious to give free
rein to his anger, and for the first few moments
he felt a man indeed.</p>

<p>The young fellow thus struck and two or three
other men now closed around him, and he was
soon occupied in warding off as best he might
the shower of blows, kicks and cuffs that fell to
his portion. The noise brought speedily to the
spot, the depot officials, one or two farmers riding
by, and all the boys in the vicinity.</p>

<p>"Stop&mdash;hold&mdash;I won't have any of that!"
cried the ticket agent, puffing up in authority.</p>

<p>"Oh! won't you?" cried one of the men
whose blood was up, and pounding away at
Thomas, whom they had succeeded in getting to
the ground.</p>

<p>"No, I won't," cried the ticket agent, "I'll
have you all arrested."</p>

<p>"Who's going to do it, I'd like to know,"
asked another man derisively.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Thomas was shouting out his case,
and succeeded in catching the ear of a farmer
who sitting on the bags of meal in his wagon
had paused to see what the trouble was about.</p>

<p>"It's my opinion," said the farmer deliberately,
and stopping to clear his throat now and
then with a sharp <i>Hem!</i> "that you want me to
give you three chaps a poundin' that man, a
taste of my whip, and it's also my opinion that
I shall do it." With that he sprang from his
wagon with surprising alertness considering he
looked so old, and, whip in hand, he advanced
upon the crowd.</p>

<p>They all fell back. He had "whip" in his eye,
and beside, every one knew Jacob Bassett, and
that there was no reason to think he would fail
to do as he said.</p>

<p>Before all could desert Thomas, however, the
last man had the benefit of the leather lash, and
he ran off rubbing his leg, and uttering several
ejaculations as if he had received enough.</p>

<p>"My man," said Farmer Bassett, tucking up
his long whip under his arm and helping Thomas
to his feet, "now what's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"I'm in trouble," said Thomas briefly.</p>

<p>"So I should think," said the old farmer with
a wise nod.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't care about myself," said Thomas not
regarding certain flapping portions of his once
neat suit, nor mindful of the other signs of his
predicament, "but it's young master and those
other boys who were left to my care." At mention
of them, he became helpless once more, and
began to bemoan his fate.</p>

<p>"Hah!" said the old farmer. He had boys
of his own, not so very long ago either, although
he looked so old, and though they were all but
one out in the world and promising to be successful
men, his heart went back to the time
when they were little chaps and running about
the farm.</p>

<p>The one who was not out in the world was
safe at rest from all temptation and suffering.
There was a tiny grave on the hill-top back of
the old homestead, and here the farmer often
stole in an odd moment, and Betsey his wife
went of an afternoon when the work was done
up, for a quiet time with her darling&mdash;the little
Richard, so early folded away from her care, and
Sundays they always went together to get peace
and resignation for the coming week.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble with the boys?" asked
the farmer, quickly.</p>

<p>Thomas looked into his face and the first
gleam of hope he had known, now radiated his
own countenance. Here was a man who evidently
meant to help, and that right speedily.</p>

<p>"Oh sir," he cried, "they're over at Sachem
Hill, and locked out of their house."</p>

<p>"Over at Sachem Hill and locked out of their
house," repeated the farmer. "How did that
happen?"</p>

<p>"'Twas me," cried Thomas miserably, and
then he laid bare his confession.</p>

<p>Farmer Bassett said never a word, only as
Thomas finished, "Come," he commanded, and
motioning him to the green wagon, he climbed
in, and seated himself again on his bags.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to stop a minute an' tell Betsey to
put us up a few things, an' while she's doin' it,
I'll hitch into the sleigh. I took the wagon to
mill, as 'twas poor draggin' along one piece o'
bare ground&mdash;an' then, says I, we'll be off for
them youngsters of yours."</p>

<p>Thomas gave a long breath of relief&mdash;and the
wagon rolled on in silence till it came to a stop
before a large red house.</p>

<h2>OUR ALPHABET OF GREAT MEN.</h2>

<h3>N.&mdash;NEWTON, SIR ISAAC.</h3>

<div class='drop-cap'>"EVERY body in nature attracts every other
body with a force directly as its mass and
inversely as the square of its distance." This
has been called "The magnificent theory of
universal gravitation which was the crowning
glory of Newton's life." I doubt not many of
you have struggled manfully with this law as
laid down in your school-books, and, having
conquered it, and fixed the principle in your
minds to stay, you may like to know something
about the philosopher himself. In 1642, a puny,
sickly baby was supposed to be moaning away
its young life in Lincolnshire, England.</div>

<p>This child's name was Isaac Newton. He belonged
to a country gentleman's family. His
father having died, his mother's second marriage
occasioned the giving of the child into
the care of his grandmother. As he grew older
he gained in health and was sent to school.
Having inherited a small estate, as soon as he
had acquired an education which was considered
sufficient to enable him to attend to the duties of
one in his position, he was removed from school
and entrusted with the management of his estate.
However, this young Newton developed a
passion for mathematical studies which led him
to neglect the business connected with his estate.
He busied himself in the construction of toys
illustrating the principles of mechanics. These
were not the clumsy work which might be expected
from the hands of a schoolboy, but were
finished with exceeding care and delicacy. It is
said there is still in existence two at least of
these toys; one is an hour-glass kept in the
rooms of the Royal Society in London.</p>

<p>Isaac Newton's mother was a wise woman in
that she did not discourage his desire for the
pursuing of his studies and for investigation.
She did not say, "Now, my son, you must put
away these notions and attend to your business.
You have a property here which it is your duty
to manage and enjoy. You should find satisfaction
in your position as a country squire and
consider that you have no need of further study."
On the contrary, this mother allowed her son
to continue his studies; he was prepared for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and entered the college at Cambridge when he
was eighteen. From that period until his death,
at eighty-five, he devoted himself unweariedly
to mathematical and philosophical studies.</p>

<div class="caption">SIR ISAAC NEWTON.</div>
</div>

<p>You all know the story of the falling apple.
He had been driven by the plague in London to
spend some time at his country-seat in Woolstrop,
and while resting one day in his garden
he saw an apple fall to the ground. Suddenly
the question occurred, Why should the apple fall
to the ground? Why, when detached from the
branch, did it not fly off in some other direction?</p>

<p>And where do you suppose he found the answer?
Read the first sentence of this article
and see if <i>you</i> find it there! The truth had been
the controlling power of all the falling apples
since the creation, but it had never before been
understood or formulated; perhaps this discovery
of the law of universal gravitation gave him more
renown than all his other labors put together.</p>

<p>He met with a sad misfortune, later, when, by
the accidental upsetting of a lighted candle, the
work of twenty years was destroyed. The story
as told by a biographer is, that Sir Isaac left his
pet dog alone in his study for a few moments,
and during this brief absence the dog overturned
the candle amongst the papers on the
study table. It is further told as an evidence
of the calmness and patience of the great man,
that he only said, "Ah! Fido, you little know
of the mischief you have done!"</p>

<p>But although he was so quiet under the great
loss, the trial was almost too much for him;
for a time his health seemed to give way, and his
mental powers suffered from the effects of the
shock. He died in 1725, and was buried in
Westminster Abbey.</p>

<h2>SOME REMARKABLE WOMEN.</h2>

<h3>K.&mdash;KAUFFMAN, MARIA ANNA ANGELICA.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="55" height="112" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">AMONG the women of history we find
not a few artists; and of these Anna
Maria Angelica Kauffman gained no
mean reputation. She lived and
worked and suffered during the latter
half of the eighteenth century, dying in 1807.
Her early life was spent in Switzerland, that
land of romantic scenery. She opened her
eyes in this world first among the mountains
that rise above the beautiful and fertile valleys
whose southern slopes teem with vines, whose
highlands afford pasturage for the flocks of the
farmers. Our artist's father was a travelling
painter. Of his work we have no account. He
is known to us only as the father of a gifted
woman. Inheriting a love of art, she found in
her father a ready sympathizer and willing helper.
He gave her such instruction as he was able, and
when he could carry her no farther in her studies,
the family removed to Milan that she might have
the opportunity of studying under more competent
teachers. She had, however, before this&mdash;and
she was only thirteen years old when they
went to Milan&mdash;painted a portrait of the
Bishop of Como, which gave her quite a reputation.
At Milan she had an opportunity of
mingling with other artists, and also the privilege
of copying the finest pictures.</div>

<p>She excelled in portrait painting; when she
went to London she was engaged to paint
the portraits of "the most distinguished and
beautiful ladies of the court." She everywhere
received much attention, both on account of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
talents as an artist, and her beauty and charming
manner. Some of her pictures are in the
Royal Gallery in Dresden; others may be seen
in the Louvre in Paris.</p>

<h2>SIR JOHN AND THE EREBUS.</h2>

<h3>II.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-f.jpg" width="57" height="111" alt="F" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">FORTY years ago last May, England
fitted Sir John out with two fine ships.
They were the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i>.</div>

<p>Away they sailed from the wharf
where many came to see them off,
among them Lady Franklin, Sir John's wife.</p>

<p>Away they pushed through the sea toward
the North. On they went, further and further
from their home, to see if they could
find the North Pole or what was called the
"Northwest Passage."</p>

<p>Soon they met icebergs, or great mountain
castles, moving down from the north. But
the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i> turned aside and sailed
north, north, north, hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>Then the winter came on. The two ships
were soon hedged in by the ice. They could
neither go forward nor backward. The ice
became thicker and thicker; the nights longer
and colder. The men were clothed in fur,
and there were stoves in the ships, but they
shivered with the cold. No word came to
them from their friends. They, however, tried
to be cheerful, hoping for spring and the
breaking up of the ice so they could sail out
of their prison and find the Northwest Passage.</p>

<p>They sang, told stories, read, celebrated
each other's birthday; good Sir John read
sermons and prayers to his men as was his custom
and exhorted them to be of good cheer.
It was a joyful thought to them of making
wonderful discoveries in that strange land
and then coming back some day with the news.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 304px;">
<img src="images/illus58.jpg" width="304" height="368" alt="portrait" />
<div class="caption">John Franklin</div>
</div>
<p>But the spring came and went, another
and another, but no tidings of Sir John. Then
there was alarm. Meetings were called, speeches
made, great sums of money raised; brave captains
and crews offered to go in search of him. Vessel after
vessel went and came, only to report failure.</p>

<p>Five years passed; seven; nine; ten&mdash;Hope
was dying&mdash;eleven. Lady Franklin did not give
up, but fitted out, at her own expense, a little ship.</p>

<p>Captain and sailors bid good-by to wives and
friends, not knowing they would ever see them
again, as they resolved not to come back till they
found out something as to the fate of Sir John.</p>

<p>So this little ship disappeared far away northward,
and, like the others, in a few weeks, was
in the midst of majestic palaces of ice.</p>

<p>But it worked its way on, when, lo! one day
as the captain was hunting here and there, he
came upon parts of a ship, and he knew it was
Sir John's. He also found Sir John's own
handwriting and many other things that told of
great sufferings and death.</p>



<p>It appeared that he had died June 11th, 1847;
but he was not found till 1857. All had perished.</p>

<p>He was a noble Christian man, with a heart
tender as a woman's.</p>

<p>When the little ship came back with the
news, England mourned as did this nation over
the fate of Sir John Franklin.</p>

<h2>FOLLOW MY LEADER.</h2>


<div class='drop-cap'>HAVE each of the company put on a sheet,
securing it around himself like the pictures
of a Roman toga. Put on his head a pillowslip,
making it assume any fanciful shape
desired, and bringing it closely around his face,
concealing features as much as possible. All this
must be done <i>before</i> assembling, as it is the object
to have players disguised as far as possible
from each other. Have your Leader chosen.
Then you must follow him implicitly; whoever
fails to, must be counted out of the game.
Those who do not wish to dress in sheet-and-pillow-case
costume must form audience. The
Leader must wear high above his pillow-case-enveloped
head, a small United States flag, so that
all can recognize him as Leader.</div>

<p>(You will remember that the fourth of
March is always the Inauguration Day, when the
President of the United States goes into the
White House as Leader for four years.)</p>

<p>Now let the Leader start to music from the
piano&mdash;through the parlors, halls, dining-room&mdash;perhaps
if the cook is pleasant, to the kitchen.
These little games do a great deal to draw all
the family together with a happy feeling. If he
stops a minute to examine anything, the company
following him in Indian file must stop too
and imitate his movements, as if examining something
closely. If he says in the course of his
travels "ooh&mdash;ooh!" just like a pig, each one
of the pillow-slip-and-sheet brigade must say
"ooh&mdash;ooh!" also in the same tone <i>without
smiling</i>, unless he laughs. If he says "cock-a-doodle-<i>doo-o!</i>"
each one must say it. Whoever
fails to follow his Leader imitating him in everything,
and whoever smiles or laughs, or says anything
unless the Leader does, must be pointed out
by the audience, dropped out of ranks, set up in
a corner, told to stand there until the game is
played out, and all take off sheets and pillow-slips&mdash;to
sit down and laugh over it all, before plates
of apples and cracked walnuts.</p>

<p>May you have a jolly time with your March
game. I wish I could play one with the Pansies.</p>

<h2>SIR EDWIN LANDSEER.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-y.jpg" width="76" height="88" alt="Y" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">YEARS ago, a man now living in Cincinnati
was sent by the President to South
America to look after the interests of
our country there. The people were
very kind to him, and, among other gifts, presented
him a parrot on his return home.</div>

<p>I spent a day at his house and had many funny
talks with Poll; parrots can talk after a fashion.</p>

<p>She was a fine lady, not so large as some you
may have seen at the New Orleans Exposition.
Some of them were from two to three feet long.
One was perfectly green; another, white; a
third, nearly all bright colors.</p>

<p>The one I saw in Cincinnati was fond of her
friends, but sulky and cross to me, a stranger.</p>

<p>She had learned many wicked words from
passers-by, swearing words even. When she
could not have her own way and, like other folks,
was out of humor, she would "let fly" her worst
opinions of people and things in her bad language.</p>

<p>At such times she did not seem so beautiful
with all her gay plumage. Few folks do appear
well when out of sorts, no matter how rich
and fashionable their clothes. Remember that.</p>

<p>In the picture you see a parrot sitting upon a
perch. It is another one and there is a long
story about it. But all stories can't be put
into <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> without bursting its covers.
However, you may hear a little about this one and
think out the rest when your thinkers get time.</p>

<p>This Pol came from a distant land. She had
such rich feathers, and could talk and sing so
well, and, withal, her manners and behavior were
so correct that she made friends of everybody.</p>

<p>So in due time Pol was treated like one of the
family and as one of the first ladies in society&mdash;so
far as a parrot could be. Her bread and drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and bed were all any bird could wish. She had
the freedom of the house. Without asking, she
could go up stairs or down, out door, into the
barn, to the top of the highest trees, sometimes
to the neighbors. She always came home at
meal and bed time. Every one, nearly, knew her
and treated her politely. Thus she forgot her
far-away relations and became happy "as happy
can be." She was now a maiden lady of sixty
years. Some parrots live to be one hundred.
Pol's life had been pleasant as a June morning.
But June doesn't last forever. Trouble came.</p>

<p>One day she went out to call and was quietly
walking home. A bad boy met her and made
some provoking remarks. Instead of paying no
attention to such creatures and going right on
her way, she stopped, listened, lost her temper
and "sauced him back." Then what should the
fellow do but strike Pol and tear out some of her
finest feathers and, leaving her half-dead, went
his way. Pol managed to drag herself home,
and, as best she could, tell what had happened.</p>

<p>How grieved they all were and wondered who
could have treated her so cruelly. They suspected
who had done it; for that boy was given
to such things. Some seem to delight in giving
pain to animals. I need not say what was
done to that hateful boy. He deserved punishment
and received it. But Poor Pol, what of
her? She was tenderly washed and coaxed to
eat and tell more about it. Her appetite left her
in spite of all that could be done and she became
sad and silent and wished to retire to bed.</p>

<p>It was hoped that she would feel better in the
morning; but when morning came, there she
sat, her wings drooping and her eyes cast down
like one that is passing through great sorrow.</p>

<p>Near by lived a lad by the name of Eddie
Landseer. He thought the world of Pol. As
soon as he heard of her misfortune he came running
in with a playmate, a bright little girl, to see
what they could do for their afflicted neighbor.</p>

<p>Eddie was a great lover of horses, dogs, birds
and almost all animals. Some say that when he
went into the woods he would always carry something
good for animals to eat and he would
somehow call the squirrels and birds down
around him from the trees. They would come
and eat from his hands and let him handle them
as tame animals do. He really seemed to know
just how some animals feel and to cheer them in
trouble. He took pains to study them as you
do your Sunday-school lesson. So in he came
with a most dainty dish for Pol.</p>

<p>He and his little friend were prettily dressed,
not to show themselves, but to please Pol, for
Eddie believed that she had an eye for beautiful
clothes like her own. But when he saw Pol,
how sad her countenance was and how she
mourned over her lost feathers, he and Bertha
could hardly keep back their tears.</p>

<p>However, they put on cheerful faces and sang
so sweetly and begged so hard Pol actually got
out of bed, arranged her feathers neatly, talking
away as though nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Now, what if I should tell you that this Eddie
became a great painter of animals! When he
was but five years old he could draw pretty good
pictures of cows and pigs; at eighteen he made
that famous picture "Dogs of St. Gothard rescuing
Travellers." Queen Victoria was so pleased
with it she put honor upon his name and everywhere
he was called Sir Edwin Landseer.</p>

<p>Some day you may see his famous picture
"Peace and War." Ten years ago was seen in
Philadelphia his wonderful painting "The Sick
Monkey." Many people would stop a long while
looking at it; the mother monkey had the sick
one in her arms. The poor thing seemed ready
to cry, while all the other monkeys looked at the
sick one with such sad eyes. It is said no artist
has done so much to teach us how to love animals.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of Mr. Henry Bergh? He
has spent many years writing, speaking and
pleading with law-makers to pass laws to protect
animals from cruelty. I suppose if the
horses of New York City, where he lives, could
speak, they would all daily shout to him as they
see him on Broadway, Thank you, dear friend
Bergh. No living man has ever cared so much
for our race as you have."</p>

<p>If they knew how, they would surely shake
hands with him, and when he comes to die
build a grand monument to his memory. It
would seem as though God's love is in his heart.
Jesus came to save the worst people, even those
who nailed him to the cruel cross. Surely Jesus
pitied the poor helpless animals. Not one sparrow
falls to the ground without his notice. Try
to be a friend to animals, won't you?</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>ARE you having a good time with the March
winds, my Blossoms? But then, you are
so scattered that you can have all sorts of times.
Some of you may be blowing around the street
corners in a way to make you think of balloons,
while others of you are picking wild-wood flowers
in the sunny South; and away down in
Maine, the boys are snowballing, while away on
the southern slopes of California the girls are
gathering roses! What a wonderful world it is!</div>

<p>Oh! do you know, my dear Pansies, I am going
West this summer? I can't tell you much
about it until the summer is over and I am settled
down again for winter work; but I mean
to keep my eyes wide open on purpose for you.
I shall be in Utah, I think, and in Kansas, and
Wisconsin, and Nebraska, and I don't know just
where, but you shall know all about it after I
have been, and returned. Wide-open eyes; that
is our motto for the summer. I know a great
many of you are going away, to the seaside, to
the mountains, to Chautauqua, to Europe, where
not? Will you be selfish, dwarfed-up little
Pansies, keeping all your delights of travel to
yourselves, or will you keep diaries of all the interesting
things you see, and hear, and learn, and
write beautiful letters for the stay-at-homes?
Why not? Let us join hands and see how much
we can use our eyes and ears for others during
the long bright summer.</p>

<div class='sig'>
Lovingly,        <span class="smcap">Pansy</span>.<br />
</div>

<p><i>Louie</i> from New York. My dear, I hope <span class="smcap">The
Pansy</span> came in time for the "little brother's
birthday." We made all possible speed. Yes,
Faye Huntington is to continue her work for
<span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> during another year. I am glad you
love her. So do I. Please give my kind regards
to your mamma, whom I remember very
well.</p>

<p><i>Mamie</i> from Connecticut. You dear little
Blossom! I am glad you have not choked yourself
with pins before you took your pledge! I
presume you think you never would have done
so; but do you really suppose there was ever a
person who choked to death with a pin, <i>on purpose</i>?
Yet there have been deaths caused in
just that way. Your mother will be glad that
you have resolved to give up so foolish and
dangerous a habit.</p>

<p><i>Emily</i> from Maryland. Your pledge commences
with the right sentence, my friend. One
who honestly trusts in His help, is sure to succeed.
I think you will find it helpful if you will
study His life on earth, and see how many proofs
you can find of His perfect unselfishness.</p>

<p><i>Maria</i> and <i>Lucy</i> from Missouri. Welcome,
my little Missouri sisters. May you blossom
luxuriantly in that sunny land. I hope the
"temper" will grow as sweet as the Southern
jessamine which I enjoyed so much in your
South land last winter, and that the little fingers
tempted to be "tardy" now, will quicken under
the spell of the earnest pledge which has been
taken.</p>

<p><i>Ward</i> from Michigan. Glad to receive you,
my boy. "I can't" is an enemy who has stolen
many a grand action from boys and girls as well
as from men and women. Did you ever notice
also, that he generally speaks what is false?
Nearly always "I can't" means "I don't want
to," or a bold "I won't."</p>

<p><i>Ina</i> from Iowa. Dear friend, do you know
of what your pledge reminds me? Of a great
many grown people who, though pledged to
obey the Lord Jesus, forget to "mind" him so
often, now that he is away. While you are carefully
keeping your pledge to obey the dear
mamma as well in her absence as when her eye
is on you, will you sometimes think of Jesus,
and his wish that we should remember always
that his eye is on us?</p>

<p><i>May</i> from Iowa. You are not alone in that
fault. I know many people who can "remember"
the faults of others, while seeming to be
quite forgetful about their own. It is a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
rule to remember nothing against any other person,
unless we believe that Jesus Christ wants us
to remember it, and speak of it, in order to help
somebody else.</p>

<p><i>Otho</i> from Iowa. Another little "high" temper.
A temper is an excellent thing if it is of
the right sort. It wants to be even; neither
"high" nor "low." Try hard to make yours
what in your honest little heart you think it
ought to be. Remember your greatest help will
be found in our Whisper Motto.</p>

<p><i>Roy</i> from Michigan. My boy, I liked your
letter ever so much. Do you know how much
that is? Yes, I am sure you do. It is so full
of suggestions for the other Pansies that I am
going to copy some of it for them. It is a great
thing to be able always to "speak pleasantly."
What a power for good you will be in this cross
world, if you keep your pledge. To be pleasant,
when everything is going crooked, or at least
seems to be, is a virtue which very few people
have.</p>

<p><i>Arthur</i> from Chicago. How is the "club"
succeeding? I am more than willing that you
should have an officer's badge if you earn it.
What "kind acts" have you succeeded in doing
since you took your pledge? Is there not some
story growing out of them that you can tell us,
and so help others?</p>

<p><i>Kitty</i> from Vermont. Yes indeed, we want
all the "kittens" of your sort that we can get
hold of. Oh! I know all about the people who
do not hang up their clothes. Aren't they
troublesome, though! What a pleasant thing
it will be to "mamma" to find all the dresses,
and sacks, and hats and hoods in their places,
after this! I should not wonder if the clothes-press
did not know itself, and if the piano, and
the table in the back hall, and the hat-rack in the
corner should feel very lonesome, in the course
of time. But a certain Pansy Badge will blush
for joy!</p>

<p><i>Bertha</i> from Connecticut. Glad you like the
badge. And <i>so</i> glad to think the poor little fingers
do not get "sucked" any more. Will you
give my dear love to "aunt Katie," and kiss her
very softly and sweetly for me? I know something
about that precious "Shut in Band;" I
used to have a dear friend who was a member
of it. But the Master one day called her out, to
do active work, and she has been in the field ever
since.</p>

<p><i>Pearl</i> from Indiana. Teeth are very important
and much abused members of society, my
dear Pearl. I hope yours will reward you for
good care, by never aching a bit. By the way,
little Pearl, I wonder if you know the fourth
commandment? See if you can tell me why I
wonder it.</p>

<p><i>Marion</i> from Iowa. We welcome our new
Western Blossom. It is astonishing to me how
many of my Blossoms hate to shut their eyes
when night comes! At least, they and "mamma"
someway cannot agree as to the best time to do
it. Now in a "truly" pansy bed, I have noticed
that the Blossoms seem to be glad when
night, and dew, and hush, tell them that the
resting time has come. Can it be, do you suppose,
that they, without souls, or brains, are more
obedient to the Gardener's voice than little human
blossoms succeed in being? Some people
who are quick-witted are strongly tempted to
"answer back," especially when they think of
something which would be "just the thing" to
say. I knew a wise man who said when he was
a boy, he had to adopt the habit of counting ten
before he answered a person in argument, because
if he didn't, he was sure to say what he
was sorry for afterwards. I have often thought
if some people I know would "count ten"
oftener, they would not say so many foolish and
disagreeable things.</p>

<p><i>Frank</i> from Ohio. Impatient, are you?
Well, there is a wonderful promise for such as
you in the Bible. See if you can find it. I
haven't the least doubt but that you want to
grow up a great man; and here is your opportunity.</p>

<p><i>Lillie</i> from Connecticut. My dear, I earnestly
hope the patience with which you waited
has long before this been rewarded. They do
seem to be very slow people in Boston, sometimes,
but when there are so many "lilies," and
roses, and pansies to be attended to all at once,
how can they help it? We are glad to get your
full name for enrollment. Are you also the secretary
of your Band? If so, we shall hope for an
account of your meetings. The Pansies like to
know how the different members of their great
army conduct their monthly meetings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lester</i> from Ohio. My boy, we are glad that
you are not only a subscriber, but a worker.
"Teasing" is really a great nuisance. Between
you and me, don't you really think so yourself?
I asked a boy who is fond of doing disagreeable
things "just for fun," whether he really thought
he should like to have them done to him, and he
opened his eyes wide, and said: "Why, of
course not!" Yet it had not seemed to occur to
him what a mean spirit he confessed in that
very sentence. I am very glad to receive your
pledge.</p>

<p><i>Jennie</i> from Connecticut. I shall want to
hear all about the bed-quilt when it is done. I
am acquainted with a society of girls who made
a beautiful album quilt not long ago. The
blocks were of silk, given by the ladies of the
church. The young girls did the work, very
nicely, and allowed their lady and gentleman
friends to write their names in the centre blocks,
for ten cents each. The money thus secured they
sent toward the support of their little adopted
girl in Alaska, and the quilt they sent for a Christmas
present to their minister's wife, who was
away from home, sick, and lonely. The names
on the blocks were those of her friends in whom
she was much interested, and many of the pieces
of silk were well known to her, and gave her
pleasant thoughts of the original givers; so the
work was a comfort and a help all around.
"Besides," said one of the girls, "we learned to
sew beautifully, that winter. Mrs. F. would
accept nothing but the very nicest stitches." A
great many people "forget" what they ought to
remember. I am glad you have left their ranks.</p>

<p><i>Ray</i> from Colorado. What a rich boy you
are to have so much company in your own home!
Also, what a good boy you must try to be, when
you have so many who will be sure to follow
your example. It is a good thing you have
taken a pledge not to "speak cross" any more.
If the twins should learn such things from you,
how sad it would be!</p>

<p><i>Minnie</i> and <i>Floy</i> from Wisconsin. My dear
little friends, it will be a great victory when you
learn not to be impatient over anything, and to
be pleasant when you feel cross! Oh yes, you
can even do such hard things as those. But let
me remind you that you will need the help of
the Whisper Motto every hour of the day. I
am glad the birthday present was a Bible. I
think you must both of you study it a little, and
try to follow it, else you would hardly have such
good reports from school. By the way, I must
tell you a story about my Bible. It was given
me when I was eight years old. On Sunday, in
church, the sermon was long, and I grew very
tired, so I thought I would put something on the
fly leaf of my new Bible which would be very
appropriate, and which would not be wrong to
write on Sunday. I worked away at it, and produced
in my best style, these lines:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Holy Bible book divine<br />
Preshus treshure thou art mine!<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Actually, that was the way I put it! Don't you
think my beautiful new Bible might have blushed,
if it could express its feelings in that way?</div>

<p><i>Lizzie</i> from Kansas. So they "bite their finger
nails" in Kansas, as well as everywhere
else! Before our P. S. was organized I had not
the least idea that fingers were so cruelly treated.
What a pleasure it is to me to think that so many
of them have peace now. We are glad to welcome
you to our roll.</p>

<p><i>Susy</i> from Elyria. There! I forgot to put
the "a" in, after Susy. Well, I suppose you are
called "Susy Sunbeam." I think that is a lovely
name. It shows there must be a good deal of
sunshine in your life. I know a young lady
whose face is always so bright and happy that
her home friends call her "Sunny," and I have
often thought she might be proud of the pet
name. I am glad you like "Grandpa's Darlings."
It is a true book. The dear grandpa
was my very own blessed father; and the children,
Minie and Grace, were my pet nieces.
Grace is now a young lady and lives in the same
house with me, and works all day with her pencils
and her paints, learning to be an artist. As
for Minie, I don't know what she does all the
long bright days. She was called years ago, to
her Father's palace; for she is the daughter of
a great King. We do not hear from her; but
we know much about the beautiful home where
she lives, and we are all looking forward to going
there, some day, to be with her, for the King
has promised to send for us&mdash;all. More than
that, he has invited any one to come who would
like to do so. Will you go?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ella</i> from New York. I do wonder what
there is about a piano which should nearly always
make young people impatient? Do you
suppose the fault is in the instrument? I have
sometimes thought that if such is the case, they
ought to go out of fashion. But perhaps the
little Pansy Badge will be too much for yours.
Let me hear how you succeed.</p>

<p><i>Clara</i> from Iowa. I hope you received the
autograph safely, my dear, and that you like the
picture. "Cack" is certainly a very original
nom de plume. What do you write? I once
had a little friend who called on me to ask how
she should finish her book! She said she knew
how to begin it, and how to make it <i>very long</i>,
but it <i>would</i> not end! I think a great many
people are troubled in that way. Don't you?</p>

<h2>"BALLAD OF THE LOST HARE."</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>NOW all you Pansies who have grown
too old to enjoy sweet cunning things
written on purpose for five and six and seven-year-old
Blossoms, may skip this article.</div>

<p>The gray-headed fathers and mothers, and the
dear sweet grandmothers who never grow old,
will enjoy it as much as the darlings themselves;
but I am aware that there is an age somewhere
between ten and sixteen when almost everything
that the babies can enjoy is "too young!" All
those are requested not to listen, while I tell
about the "Ballad Of The Lost Hare." A big
book, with a bright cover, and with a great many
colored pictures large and bright, and with the
cunningest little story running all through the
book, about a poor little, dear little, naughty little
hare.</p>

<p>Yes, I am going to copy just a bit of the introduction
for you. Listen:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Far from wild, far from wood,<br />
In a field rich and good;<br />
Near to hill and winding glade,<br />
Lived the naughtiest Hare, ever was made.<br />
<br />
Father scolded, mother whipped,<br />
But every day away he slipped.<br />
Brothers three, and sisters two,<br />
Cried and cried, as off he flew.<br />
<br />
Sore-sore-sore was the sobbing,<br />
Wild-wild-wild was his race;<br />
Only the woods to echo his footsteps,<br />
Only the winds his hiding place.<br />
</div>

<p>After the introduction, come the stories of his
adventures; and the pictures of them. Oh! but
you would be so sorry for him if you could see
the cow, and the goat, and the pony that scared
him nearly out of his small wits!</p>

<p>And then the conclusion! Ah me, the sad
ending of it all!</p>

<div class='poem'>
Do you suppose he wishes his home to see,<br />
His sisters two, and his brothers three?<br />
Would he like to lie down in his own little bed?<br />
And does he recall what his father said?<br />
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 282px;">
<img src="images/illus71.jpg" width="282" height="248" alt="running hare" />
<div class="caption">OFF HE FLEW.</div>
</div>

<p>There! I mustn't tell you any more, or the
whole story will be out. Buy it, my darlings,
and read it for yourselves; it is in nice clear
print. Or, if you haven't quite managed that
business of reading yet, let me whisper a word
in your ear: those wise old brothers and sisters
of yours, who have known how to read these five
years, and are ciphering in fractions, and writing
essays on "Spring," will be willing to read the
story, just to please you, you know, not for their
own amusement, at all; oh no! Try them.</p>

<p>Now who do you think wrote it for you?</p>

<p>Who but Margaret Sidney herself! the author
of "Five Little Peppers," which you liked so
much; and the author of "Kensington Junior,"
and you know how many more nice things. Of
course you will want the book.</p>

<p>The price? Oh yes, surely, I had almost forgotten.
Why, it has a special price on purpose
for the wee P. S. Blossoms. Only sixty cents.
Think of it!</p>

<div class='adtitle2'><span class="smcap">prospectus&mdash;OUR LITTLE MEN AND WOMEN&mdash;for 1886.</span></div>

<div class='hang1'>This magazine, for youngest readers, has earned golden gratitude from teachers and parents
this past year. While its short stories and beautiful pictures have made it welcome everywhere as a
general Magazine for Little Folks, its series of instructive articles have rendered it of unrivalled value
to educators. For 1886 several specialties have been prepared in accordance with the suggestions of
teachers who wish to start their "little primaries" in the lines on which older brothers and sisters are
being taught. As a beginning in American History, there will be twelve charming chapters about</div>


<div class='adtitle4'>THE ADVENTURES OF COLUMBUS.</div>

<div class='hang1'>This story of the Great Discoverer, while historically correct and valuable, will be perfectly
adapted to young minds and fitted to take hold upon a child's attention and memory; many pictures.</div>


<div class='adtitle4'>LITTLE TALKS ABOUT INSECT LIFE</div>

<div class='hang1'>will interest the children in one branch of Natural History; with anecdotes and pictures.</div>


<div class='adtitle4'>OUR COLORADO PETS</div>

<div class='hang1'>will describe wild creatures little known to children in general. These twelve stories all
are true, and are full of life and adventure; each will be illustrated.</div>


<div class='adtitle4'>"ME AND MY DOLLS"</div>

<div class='hang1'>is a "cunning little serial story," written for American children by the popular English
author, Miss L. T. Meade. It will have Twelve Full-page Pictures by Margaret Johnson.</div>

<div class='hang1'>From time to time fresh "Stories about Favorite Authors" will be given, so that teachers
and friends may have material for little literature lessons suited to young children.</div>

first place in the hearts of the children, and in the approval of earnest-minded parents. Among the more
interesting features for 1886 will be Pansy's serial story,</div>


<div class='adtitle4'>REACHING OUT,</div>

<div class='hang1'>being a further account of "Little Fishers: and their Nets." The Golden Text Stories,
under the title, "Six O'clock in the Evening," will be told by a dear old Grandma, who knows many interesting
things about what happened to herself when she was a little girl. Margaret Sidney will furnish
a charming story,</div>


<div class='adtitle4'>ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGON,</div>

<div class='hang1'>to run through the year. Rev. C. M. Livingston will tell stories of discoveries, inventions,
books, people, places. Faye Huntington will be a regular contributor during the year. Pansy will
take the readers with her wherever she goes, in papers under the title of</div>


<div class='adtitle4'>WHERE I WENT, AND WHAT I SAW.</div>

<div class='hang1'>There will be, in each number, a selection from our best standard poets suitable for recitation
in school or circle. From time to time colloquies for Mission Bands, or for general school exercises,
will appear. There will be new and interesting books for the members of the Pansy Society, and, as
before, a generous space will be devoted to answers to correspondents in the P. S. Corner.</div>

<h3>ARTISTIC FAC-SIMILE REPRODUCTIONS OF
ORIGINAL PICTURES.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-d-art.jpg" width="40" height="33" alt="D" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi4">DESIRING to bring within reach of all homes Pictures of real charm and real art value, we began,
October 1st, the publication of a series of superb fac-simile reproductions of the finest original
pictures belonging to the <span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span> magazine.</div>

<p>This collection of water colors, oil paintings, and line drawings, gathered during the past ten years,
includes fine examples of eminent American and foreign artists: Walter Shirlaw, Mary Hallock Foote, Wm.
T. Smedley, Howard Pyle, Henry Bacon, Jessie Curtis Shepherd, Harry Fenn, F. S. Church, Chas. S.
Reinhart, Miss L. B. Humphrey, F. Childe Hassam, E. H. Garrett, F. H. Lungren, H. Bolton Jones,
St. John Harper, Miss Kate Greenaway, George Foster Barnes, Hy. Sandham, and others.</p>

<p>And while the skill of foremost engravers has enabled us to give in the magazine many beautiful engravings
from these originals, the mechanical limitations of the graver, and of the steam press, render these "counterfeit
presentments," at their best, but disappointing attempts, to those who have seen the originals with their
greater delicacy and richness and strength. The real touch of the artist's brush, the finer subtler atmosphere,
the full beauty and significance, and the technical excellence, is missing&mdash;and it is these features that are
retained in these fac-similes.</p>

<p>The method of reproduction employed is the new photogravure process of the Lewis Co., which in result
is only equalled by the famous work of Goupil &amp; Cie of Paris. Each impression is on the finest India paper,
imported expressly for this purpose, and backed by the best American plate paper, size 12x15 inches. Only
a limited number of hand proofs will be made. Ordinary black inks are not employed, but special pigments
of various beautiful tones, the tone for each picture being that best suited to emphasize its peculiar sentiment.</p>

<p>These beautiful fac-simile reproductions are equally adapted for portfolios or for framing. They are
issued under the name of</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/wa-artprints-smaller.jpg" width="300" height="37" alt="WIDE AWAKE ART PRINTS" />
</div>

<p>Along with the unfailing and refined pleasure a portfolio of these beautiful pictures will give, attention
is called to their educational value to young art students, and to all young people, as the photogravure process
preserves each artist's peculiar technique, showing how the drawing is really made, something that engraving
largely obliterates.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Wide Awake Art Prints</span> <i>are issued on the first and fifteenth of each month, and are regularly
announced in the magazine.</i></p>


<div class='center'><b>SPECIAL.</b></div>

<p>Keeping in view the interests of our readers, we have decided not to place the Art Prints in the hands of
agents or the general trade. In this way our patrons are saved the retailers' and jobbers' profits, so that
while these beautiful works of art, if placed in the picture stores, would bear a retail price of $3.00 to $10.00,
we are able to furnish them to our readers and patrons at a</p>

<div class='center'>
<span class='gesp'>UNIFORM NET PRICE OF ONLY FIFTY CENTS EACH.</span><br />
</div>

<p>Orders for half-yearly sets of twelve will be received at $5.50 in advance; and for yearly sets of twenty-four
at $10.00 in advance. All pictures are sent in pasteboard rolls, postpaid. Half-yearly and yearly subscribers
will receive each monthly pair in one roll. Portfolios, suitable for holding twenty-four or less, will be
supplied, postpaid, for 75 cts.</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
